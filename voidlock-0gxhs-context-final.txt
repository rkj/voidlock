Final polish for UI casing standardization to Capital Case as per docs/spec/ui.md#8.

Remaining minor tasks:
1. Update src/engine/managers/CommandExecutor.ts:
   - Change "Picking up" to "Picking Up" (L158, L173)
2. Update src/renderer/ui/SoldierWidget.ts:
   - Change "LVL" to "Lvl" (L211, L251)
3. Audit any remaining all-caps text in the browser.
4. Verify everything with the E2E test: tests/e2e/UICasingStandardization.test.ts.
   - Ensure the test covers all updated screens.
