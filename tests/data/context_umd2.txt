The build failed with 60 TypeScript errors. Most of them are missing 'damageDealt' and 'objectivesCompleted' properties in 'Unit' objects (both in tests and in CoreEngine.ts).

Example error:
src/engine/CoreEngine.ts:170:22 - error TS2352: Conversion of type '{ ... }' to type 'Unit' may be a mistake because neither type sufficiently overlaps with the other.
  Property 'damageDealt' is missing in type '{ ... }' but required in type 'Unit'.
  Property 'objectivesCompleted' is missing in type '{ ... }' but required in type 'Unit'.

Please fix all these errors by adding the missing properties (defaulting to 0) to the relevant object literals.
Also, ensure 'soldierAim' is present in 'CampaignSoldier' mocks if you encounter related errors, as mentioned in the task description.
