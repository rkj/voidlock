# US_009: Narrative Encounters

## Persona & Goal

As a Commander, I want to make choices during random encounters that help my campaign progress.

## Prerequisites

- Sector Map active.
- Player selects an "Event" (Signal) node.

## Action List

1. Click "Event" node -> Narrative dialog modal opens.
2. Read the scenario text (e.g., "Derelict Lifeboat").
3. Click a choice (e.g., "Search for survivors").
4. Observe the outcome -> Dialog updates with result (e.g., "Found 200 Scrap").
5. Click "Continue" -> Return to Sector Map, node is cleared.

## Visual Acceptance Criteria

- Dialog modal follows the tactical theme (no standard browser UI).
- Choice buttons are clearly labeled and themed.
- Outcome text clearly highlights gained/lost resources.
