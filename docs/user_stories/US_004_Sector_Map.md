# US_004: Strategic Navigation

## Persona & Goal

As a Commander, I want to plan my route through the sector so that I can reach the Boss node with maximum resources.

## Prerequisites

- Sector Map active.
- Previous mission completed (at least one Rank 1 node cleared).

## Action List

1. Observe the Sector Map -> Branching paths between ranks are visible.
1. Observe connections -> Lines must NEVER cross (no 'X' shapes).
1. Click an accessible node in the next Rank -> Node is highlighted, "Launch" becomes available.
1. Observe node icons -> Elite nodes have Skulls, Boss node is unique.

## Visual Acceptance Criteria

- Current position is clearly marked.
- Unreachable nodes are dimmed or grayed out.
- Lines between nodes are smooth and styled (not raw pixels).
