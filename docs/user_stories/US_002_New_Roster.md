# US_002: Building the Roster

## Persona & Goal
As a Commander, I want to expand my squad and personalize my soldiers so that I feel connected to my team and prepared for losses.

## Prerequisites
- Sector Map (Bridge) active.
- At least 100 Scrap available.

## Action List
1. Click "Barracks" tab in Campaign Shell -> Barracks Screen opens.
2. Click "Recruit (100 Scrap)" on an empty roster slot -> New soldier appears.
3. Observe the new soldier's name -> Must be a sci-fi military name, not a generic ID.
4. Click the "Inspect/Manage" button on a soldier -> Soldier Inspector opens.
5. Click the "Rename" icon next to the soldier name -> Name becomes an editable text field.
6. Enter "Sgt. Slaughter" and press Enter -> Name updates and persists.
7. Observe Soldier Stats (HP, Speed, Aim) -> Displayed as icons with tooltips.

## Visual Acceptance Criteria
- Soldier cards in roster are sorted by health status (Healthy > Wounded > Dead).
- Recruitment button is disabled if Scrap < 100.
- Rename field has clear visual focus when editing.
- No "Tactical Numbers" (e.g., "(1)") are visible on this screen.
