# Session TODO

- [x] 1) **Unit Speed UI**: Display raw speed (e.g., 25) instead of derived tiles/sec (e.g., 2.5).
- [x] 2) **Equipment Pre-population**: Soldiers should start with their current loadout in the equipment screen.
- [x] 3) **Equipment Stats**: Show stats for items in the armory list.
- [x] 4) **Global Supplies Info**: Show prices, stats, and descriptions for global supplies (Grenades, Scanners, etc.).
- [x] 5) **Global Items In-Game**: Implement UI to use global items (Grenades, Medkits) during missions.
- [x] 6) **Separate Configs**: Custom Mission and Campaign Mission settings should not overwrite each other.
- [x] 7) **Lock Campaign Config**: Disable mission settings (map size, seed, etc.) for Campaign missions.
- [x] 8) **Unified Stat UI**: Use the same icon-based stat display from the Top Bar in the Squad Selection screen.
- [x] 9) **Soldier vs Weapon Stats**: Fix "Soldier Equipment" panel to correctly separate/display Soldier stats vs Weapon stats.
- [x] 10) **Move Command Mapping**: Map discovered rooms to sequential keys (1-9, A-Z) for the Move command.
- [x] 11) **Move Menu Refresh**: Refresh the target list dynamically when new rooms are discovered while the menu is open.
- [x] 12) **Room Overlay**: Improve room label visibility (larger, centered, clear background) and only show relevant keys.
- [x] 13) **Upgrade Commands**: Implement Orders submenu (Move/Overwatch/Explore/Hold).
- [x] 14) **Remove Agent Control**: Remove the "Agent Control" toggle; units are always player-controlled.
