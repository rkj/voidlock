Task: Implement Innate AI Profiles (STAND_GROUND, RUSH, RETREAT).

Current Status:
- Added AIProfile enum and updated Unit/Archetype types in `src/shared/types.ts` and `src/engine/CoreEngine.ts`.
- Created regression test `src/engine/tests/regression_ocmi_ai_profiles.test.ts`.
- Implemented initial logic in `src/engine/managers/UnitManager.ts` inside the autonomous decision block.

Problem:
The regression tests are failing:
- RUSH unit (Assault) is NOT moving towards the enemy (expected pos > initial pos).
- RETREAT unit (Medic) is NOT moving away from the enemy (expected pos < initial pos).

This implies the `MOVE_TO` commands are not being issued or executed.

Hypothesis:
1. The enemies might not be detected as "visible" in the test setup.
2. The `threats` array might be empty.
3. The logic inside `if (threats.length > 0 ...)` might have a bug preventing execution.

Instructions:
1. Read `src/engine/managers/UnitManager.ts` to understand the current implementation.
2. Debug the issue (add logging if needed, or analyze the code).
3. Fix the logic in `UnitManager.ts` to ensure RUSH and RETREAT behaviors work as specified.
4. Verify with `npx vitest run src/engine/tests/regression_ocmi_ai_profiles.test.ts`.
5. Run all tests to ensure no regressions.
