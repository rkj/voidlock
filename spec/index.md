# Voidlock Specifications

The specifications have been split into focused documents to improve context management.

- **[Core Mechanics](spec/core_mechanics.md)**: The current, implemented, and stable game design document. **Agents should read this file by default.**
- **[Backlog & Future](spec/backlog.md)**: Planned features, ideas, and roadmap items not yet in scope for current tasks.

**Note to Agents:**
When asked to "Read spec.md", you should instead read `spec/core_mechanics.md` unless explicitly researching future features.
