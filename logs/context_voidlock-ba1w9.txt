The previous sub-agent timed out because the E2E test `tests/e2e/ReplayMissionBug.test.ts` hung for > 5 minutes. 
Next steps for you:
1. Fix the E2E test `tests/e2e/ReplayMissionBug.test.ts` so it doesn't time out.
2. Implement the bug fix for the Replay mission feature (everything is frozen, no commands panel visible, unable to unpause).
3. Do not run commands that hang indefinitely. If an E2E test is hanging, debug it without running it for 5 minutes.
