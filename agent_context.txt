FAILED_VERIFICATION: The previous execution timed out during E2E test execution.

Specifically, your Puppeteer E2E test in `tests/e2e/UIBinderSync.test.ts` is failing because `#btn-launch-mission` is not found or not clickable. Only `debug_main_menu.png` was created, indicating that clicking `#btn-menu-custom` might have failed, or the transition to the custom mission menu didn't complete.

NEXT STEPS:
1. Fix the E2E test navigation. Ensure you wait for the correct screens and elements to load. You may need to review existing passing E2E tests (e.g. `tests/e2e/Integration/ScreenFlow.test.ts` or similar) to see how they navigate the menus.
2. Complete the implementation of the Reactive UI Data Binding (`UIBinder`) for the mission controls (speed slider, pause toggle, threat bar).
3. Verify that clicking Pause correctly moves the speed slider via the two-way loop (using your fixed E2E test).
4. Run `npm run lint` and `npm run build` to ensure no errors.
5. Provide a summary upon completion.
