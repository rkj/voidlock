# Product Guide: Xenopurge

## Initial Concept
Xenopurge is a deterministic, Real-Time with Pause (RTwP) tactical squad combat game set in a claustrophobic spaceship environment. It combines the strategic depth of classic grid-based tactical games with modern procedural generation and a deterministic simulation engine.

## Target Audience
The project targets two primary groups:
- **Classic Tactical Fans:** Players who appreciate the methodical, high-stakes gameplay of classics like Space Hulk (1993) and seek a modern, accessible browser-based interpretation.
- **Casual Roguelike Gamers:** Players looking for quick, high-variety tactical sessions driven by procedural generation and sci-fi themes.

## Core Differentiators
- **Real-Time with Pause (RTwP):** Provides a unique tactical rhythm where players can manage a squad in real-time but pause at any moment to issue precise orders and react to threats.
- **Advanced Procedural Generation:** Leveraging a "Content Pack" system to deliver high-density, tree-structured map layouts that ensure every mission feels unique and claustrophobic.

## Roadmap & Priorities
1. **Polish & UX (Current Focus):** Refining the "look and feel" of combat, improving feedback mechanisms (tracers, health bars), and optimizing the keyboard-driven control scheme to transition from a technical prototype to a polished demo.
2. **Content Expansion:** Implementing the campaign structure, mission progression, and diversifying content packs to increase replayability and depth.
