# Project Workflow

## Guiding Principles

1. **Beads is the Source of Truth:** All work must be tracked via `bd`.
2. **The Tech Stack is Deliberate:** Changes to the tech stack must be documented in `tech-stack.md` *before* implementation
3. **Test-Driven Development:** Write unit tests before implementing functionality
4. **High Code Coverage:** Aim for >80% code coverage for all modules
5. **User Experience First:** Every decision should prioritize user experience
6. **Non-Interactive & CI-Aware:** Prefer non-interactive commands. Use `CI=true` for watch-mode tools (tests, linters) to ensure single execution.

## Task Workflow

All tasks follow a strict lifecycle:

### Standard Task Workflow (Beads & Jujutsu)

1. **Select Task:** Run `bd ready` to find the next prioritized task.
2. **Mark In Progress:** Run `bd update <id> --status in_progress` to claim the task.
3. **Write Failing Tests (Red Phase):**
   - Create a new test file for the feature or bug fix.
   - Write one or more unit tests that clearly define the expected behavior and acceptance criteria for the task.
   - **CRITICAL:** Run the tests (`npx vitest run`) and confirm that they fail as expected. This is the "Red" phase of TDD. Do not proceed until you have failing tests.
4. **Implement to Pass Tests (Green Phase):**
   - Write the minimum amount of application code necessary to make the failing tests pass.
   - Run the test suite again and confirm that all tests now pass. This is the "Green" phase.
5. **Refactor (Optional but Recommended):**
   - With the safety of passing tests, refactor the implementation code and the test code to improve clarity, remove duplication, and enhance performance without changing the external behavior.
   - Rerun tests to ensure they still pass after refactoring.
6. **Verify Coverage:** Run coverage reports using Vitest (e.g., `npx vitest run --coverage`).
   - Target: >80% coverage for new code.
7. **Document Deviations:** If implementation differs from tech stack:
   - **STOP** implementation
   - Update `tech-stack.md` with new design
   - Add dated note explaining the change
   - Resume implementation
8. **Task Closure & Commit:**
   - **Close Task:** Run `bd close <id> --reason "Implemented <feature>..."`
   - **Commit:** Run `jj commit -m "<type>(<scope>): <description>"`
   - **Important:** The commit message MUST include the Beads Task ID and a summary of the work.
     Example: `feat(ui): Create basic HTML structure for calculator (bd-123)`


### Epic/Milestone Completion Protocol

**Trigger:** This protocol is executed when all tasks within a Beads Epic or Milestone are completed.

1.  **Announce Protocol Start:** Inform the user that the Epic is complete.

2.  **Ensure Test Coverage:**
    -   Identify all files modified during the Epic.
    -   Verify that valid tests exist for all modified code files.
    -   If tests are missing, create them before proceeding.

3.  **Execute Automated Tests:**
    -   Run the full test suite: `npx vitest run`
    -   Ensure all tests pass.

4.  **Manual Verification:**
    -   Propose a manual verification plan based on the Epic's goals (`spec.md` or Beads description).
    -   Ask the user to perform the verification or confirm expectations.

5.  **Checkpoint Commit:**
    -   Create a checkpoint commit using `jj commit`.
    -   Message format: `chore(release): Complete Epic <EPIC_NAME>`

6.  **Close Epic:**
    -   Run `bd close <epic_id> --reason "All tasks completed and verified."`


### Quality Gates

Before marking any task complete, verify:

- [ ] All tests pass
- [ ] Code coverage meets requirements (>80%)
- [ ] Code follows project's code style guidelines (as defined in `code_styleguides/`)
- [ ] All public functions/methods are documented (e.g., docstrings, JSDoc, GoDoc)
- [ ] Type safety is enforced (e.g., type hints, TypeScript types, Go types)
- [ ] No linting or static analysis errors (using the project's configured tools)
- [ ] Works correctly on mobile (if applicable)
- [ ] Documentation updated if needed
- [ ] No security vulnerabilities introduced

## Development Commands

**AI AGENT INSTRUCTION: This section should be adapted to the project's specific language, framework, and build tools.**

### Setup
```bash
# Example: Commands to set up the development environment (e.g., install dependencies, configure database)
# e.g., for a Node.js project: npm install
# e.g., for a Go project: go mod tidy
```

### Daily Development
```bash
# Example: Commands for common daily tasks (e.g., start dev server, run tests, lint, format)
# e.g., for a Node.js project: npm run dev, npm test, npm run lint
# e.g., for a Go project: go run main.go, go test ./..., go fmt ./...
```

### Before Committing
```bash
# Example: Commands to run all pre-commit checks (e.g., format, lint, type check, run tests)
# e.g., for a Node.js project: npm run check
# e.g., for a Go project: make check (if a Makefile exists)
```

## Testing Requirements

### Unit Testing
- Every module must have corresponding tests.
- Use appropriate test setup/teardown mechanisms (e.g., fixtures, beforeEach/afterEach).
- Mock external dependencies.
- Test both success and failure cases.

### Integration Testing
- Test complete user flows
- Verify database transactions
- Test authentication and authorization
- Check form submissions

### Mobile Testing
- Test on actual iPhone when possible
- Use Safari developer tools
- Test touch interactions
- Verify responsive layouts
- Check performance on 3G/4G

## Commit Guidelines

### Message Format
```
<type>(<scope>): <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer]
```

### Types
- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation only
- `style`: Formatting, missing semicolons, etc.
- `refactor`: Code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- `test`: Adding missing tests
- `chore`: Maintenance tasks

### Examples
```bash
git commit -m "feat(auth): Add remember me functionality"
git commit -m "fix(posts): Correct excerpt generation for short posts"
git commit -m "test(comments): Add tests for emoji reaction limits"
git commit -m "style(mobile): Improve button touch targets"
```
