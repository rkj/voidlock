You are a senior architect. Your task is to write an Architecture Decision Record (ADR) file.
File path: docs/adr/0039-separation-of-custom-and-campaign-state.md

Goal: Define the architecture for separating Custom Mission state from Campaign state.
Context: Currently, Custom Missions can access and modify Campaign soldiers (e.g., reviving them), which is a bug. Custom Missions should be completely isolated.

Requirements for the ADR:
1. Define strict boundaries between Campaign State and Custom Mission State.
2. Custom Soldiers should not have IDs that link them to the Campaign.
3. Address Versioning: How do we handle changes to Soldier/Squad data structures in the future?
4. Address Persistence: Custom Squads might be saved/loaded (e.g. "Last Used Squad"), but they must not be mixed with the persistent Campaign Roster.
5. Do NOT write implementation code. Only write the markdown document.
6. Use the standard ADR template (Title, Status, Context, Decision, Consequences).

Output:
A single file: docs/adr/0039-separation-of-custom-and-campaign-state.md
